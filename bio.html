<h2>Meet Mrs. Rachel David</h2>

	<td><p>Hello! I am so happy you stopped by my personal website. Here you will learn a little about me and my creative process.
	I am a proud mom to a wonderful and amazingly smart little princess. I have also been blessed to be married to my soulmate for the past 5 years. Outside of my web development activities, I am actively involved in my church community and serve in the capacity of both local minister and communications director.</p>
	<p>I fell in love with web design back in college and have never looked back. Since then, I have designed a number of my own websites as well as that of some of the churches within our my denomination. I am a firm believer that your website is a reflection of you. I would take it even further and say that your website is the very first impression a potential client or visitor has of your business or organization. Therefore, it is one of the main items that should draw your attention.</p></td>
